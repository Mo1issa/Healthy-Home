## 📌 Project Description

### 🥗 **Healthy Home: Empowering Better Eating Habits**

**Healthy Home** is a modern web-based application designed to help individuals make healthier food choices effortlessly. In a world filled with fast food and busy schedules, maintaining a nutritious diet can be challenging. That’s where Healthy Home comes in.

We built **Healthy Home** to simplify the discovery of **delicious, nutritious meals** using the free and community-powered **[TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)**. The app generates **random healthy meal suggestions**, allows users to **search for meals**, **view full recipes**, and even **save their favorites** for later.

- To provide a **quick and interactive way** to discover new dishes
- To promote **meal diversity** beyond everyday eating habits

### 🛠️ What it does

- Fetches and displays **10–12 random meals** on page load
- Allows users to **search meals by name**
- Provides **detailed recipe instructions**, ingredients, and YouTube tutorials
- Lets users **mark favorite meals** and view them later
- Features a clean UI with **navigation to Home, About, and Contact pages**
